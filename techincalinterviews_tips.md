Technical Interviews
tips:

1. Communication
    1. talk through your code as you are doing it (practice this!)  
    2. talk through your code as you are writing it on a white board or a computer (ask where you will be coding for the technical portion!)  
    3. use a language that you are comfortable with (don't use a language you are uncomfortable with just to try to impress a reviewer)  
2. Solving the problem 
    1. start with the simple solution that you can think of
    2. if you discard an approach, make sure to explain why
    3. take the hints from the interviewer - if they make a suggestion of ask a question, give it due consideration
    4. ask clarifying questions
    5. think about edge cases-after writing your code, walk through it with an example (or two, if it's relatively simple)
3. then move on to a more efficient/more complex solution once you have something that is working
4. know what algorithms that have runtimes of n, n^2, n^n, log(n), n! look like in general
5. make sure you've done your research on the company and have some questions prepared to ask the interviewer
